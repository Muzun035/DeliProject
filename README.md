# DELI-cious Order System

## Description of the Project

This project is a Java console application that serves as a point of sales system for "DELI-cious", a custom sandwich shop. The application allows users to create, customize, and place sandwich orders. Users can choose bread type, sandwich size, toppings, sauces, and also add drinks and chips to their orders. The purpose of the project is to automate the order-taking process, reducing reliance on paper-based methods and providing a better customer experience.

The intended users are the shop staff and customers who want to streamline the ordering process. The main functionality includes customizing sandwiches, adding drinks and chips, calculating the total price, and generating receipts for the orders. The application aims to solve the problem of managing orders efficiently, reducing human error, and speeding up the order process.
